## Into to Creative Coding

These tutorials are designed for folks who are new to coding.

If you've never written a line of code before, or if you've taken an intro course and want to learn more about creative coding, these are for you!

- Start with the [How to Learn Coding](/tutorials/how-to/learn-coding) meta-guide about learning with Happy Coding!
- Are you new to coding? Start learning about creative coding with the [p5.js tutorials](/tutorials/p5js).
- Have some Java experience? Start with the [Processing tutorials](/tutorials/processing)!
